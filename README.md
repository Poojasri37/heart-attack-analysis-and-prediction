# heart-attack-analysis-and-prediction
I've successfully deployed a heart disease prediction model using Gradio! This journey has been nothing short of incredible, as I explored and tested numerous regression and classification models before deploying the one with the highest accuracy.
One of the most rewarding moments was predicting the heart condition of a 63-year-old patient based on his hospital report, showcasing how this model can significantly contribute to medical resources and aid in early diagnosis.
ðŸ’¡ This project taught me the importance of precision, persistence, and the impact of data-driven solutions in healthcare. I am eager to dive deeper into this domain and explore new possibilities.
ðŸš€ If you have any questions about the deployment process, the dataset, or the modeling techniques, feel free to reach outâ€”I'm always happy to share insights and learn from others.
